### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi there! I'm a software developer with a passion for building user-friendly and efficient web applications.

💻 I specialize in JavaScript, and have expertise in Vue, React, and Express frameworks.

🚀 I'm always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow my skills and stay ahead in the field.

💡 Java is also a language I love, and I enjoy exploring its possibilities for building robust applications.

🌍 When I'm not coding, I love to travel and experience new cultures. I also enjoy cycling and exploring the great outdoors.

📚 In my free time, I also enjoy reading books on science and personal growth. I believe in continuously learning and improving oneself.

🌱 I'm currently learning Flutter and excited about the possibilities for building beautiful and performant mobile applications.
